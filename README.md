# KRI Website

(Project Still in Progress)

This website allows mechanical engineers to model 3D stl files and apply different
types of fixes like filling in a hole. These fixes are calculated by a process of backend
functions created by Northeastern mechanical engineering Teaching Staff and Masters students.
These STL files are modeled using React-Three-Fiber (A React wrapper for Three.JS) to allow for
interaction with 3D messhes.
